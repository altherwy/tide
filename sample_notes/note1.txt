But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan . China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net . Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time . Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .
